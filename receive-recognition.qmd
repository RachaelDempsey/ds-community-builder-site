*Placeholder for more info*

Remember to record wins, show the value of your community & receive the recognition you deserve. Getting support and recognition for the value you are providing is important to not getting burnt out.

Community helps our organizations:  

* solve problems faster
* recruit & retain talent
* grow your analytic maturity
* get value out of spend (data science tools & employees!)
* look innovative among others in the industry
* and much more — identify what’s important to your leadership

Come up with your own metrics to show value.

Completely fake example:  

* 100 data scientists engaged in the community, learning from each other
* half a million dollar value with this one example
* This example uses:  
    * average data science salary (100K)
    * Each member saving 2-hours each week by collaborating with others,            * learning more efficient ways of doing things, etc.
