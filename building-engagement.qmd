A common challenge with communities, is shifting from members only consuming information to sharing with each other. How can we help each other increase engagement?

Creating a welcoming, open environment that people want to be a part of is a crucial part to building a thriving community.

### Back to basics

Think of virtual events as someone coming over to a party at your house. When someone walks in the front door, we don't expect them to all be the life of the party immediately. Similarly, it is going to take time for someone to start leading conversations and/or presenting at a community group.

1. Welcome them in: take their jacket, show them around:
      - Welcome people into our virtual space the same way: say hello, introduce yourself, let them know how they can ask questions, explain what the space is and how they can interact with others, etc. 
2. Start a conversation to introduce them to someone else:
      - Try to introduce people who have shared interests, bring people into the conversation, or simply give permission for conversation to happen in the chat as well
3. Offer them food and drinks, make sure they're happy:
      - Serve content that is useful to those attending, provide a way to answer their most pressing questions, and ask for their feedback

### Create a welcoming environment.

It’s important to explicitly tell people what to expect and that all are welcome. For example:  

- You may let people know this is an inclusive space, open to all regardless of their experience or background
- Try letting people know ahead of an event that they’re free to join to just listen-in as well and don’t necessarily have to participate
- Make it clear how to ask questions and give people an option to ask anonymously
- Be ware of terms/lingo that new attendees may not know. Share definitions in the chat when acronyms come up.

A welcoming environment may look a lot different to you as the organizer than it does to a new attendee. 

Are there people that have joined who may be open to giving you feedback? Try connecting with a few members to learn from them about their experience. For example: How did they find out about the group? Did it take them a few months to feel comfortable joining after learning about it?

### Build relationships by thanking people

At community events, try to take note of the people joining for the first time and those that are becoming regulars. (Maybe you can't do this with everyone - but give it a try with 5-10 people each event)

Send a note to say thank you to people for joining or for their contribution to the discussion. A simple recognition of them being there may inspire them to come back and contribute next time as well.

This also opens the door to a conversation. They may share feedback that will help with future events or let you know what worked well for them.

### Observe the unsaid

After a community event, it can be helpful to take a few minutes to reflect on the experience and asses how it felt to you. Are there opportunities to learn from something that wasn't shared as well?

For example:  

* Did you notice that there weren't as many women from the company on the call today?
* Did you notice a few people had unmuted but didn't end up speaking?
* What was the tone of the chat? Is there something you can do next time to kick off a conversation in the chat from the start?

Perhaps you can visualize the journey that your community members take. What path did someone take that allowed them to eventually feel comfortable presenting. Is there a way to help recreate that for others?
