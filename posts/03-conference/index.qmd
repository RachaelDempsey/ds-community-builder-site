An internal data science conference is a great way to meet others across your organization and grow your community.

It can help keep your team current on new technology, increase collaboration, give people a view into the work being done in other parts of the organization, and celebrate that work.

## How will you market the event?

## What is the follow-up?

This is a great opportunity to build relationships across the company. The follow-up actions are just as important as the event itself. Think about the ways you can keep people connected in between these conferences.

-   Will you share recordings and slides?
-   How will people stay connected after the event?

#### **Examples:**

**AstraZeneca:**

AstraZeneca spoke about their internal R Conference, #AZRC2022, in a [blog post](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/building-a-community-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry/) and meetup. This was a fully virtual, half-day conference with Max Kuhn as a keynote speaker, more than 30 speakers, and close to 100 poster authors. They ran three parallel tracks: governance, machine learning, and reproducibility.

**World Bank**

The World Bank hosted a Shiny Day (actually 2-days!) to demonstrate how Shiny can be used in the context of bank projects. From their [event overview site](https://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2021/04/28/-r-shiny-days), this included a series of lightning talks, a keynote by Carson Sievert from Posit's Shiny team, and interactive workshops.

The site linked above includes more detail, but the general agenda for this was:

Day 1:

-   9:30 - 11am: Beginners workshop - "How to build a Shiny app"
-   11:15 - 12:30: 7 different lightning talks (6-minutes each)
-   12:45 - 2:15: Intermediate workshop - "How to customize reactions"

Day 2:

-   9:30 - 11am: Advanced workshop - "How to customize appearance"
-   11:15 - 12:30: Posit Keynote
-   12:45 - 2:15: Advanced workshop - "Shiny in production: maintenance and speed"
