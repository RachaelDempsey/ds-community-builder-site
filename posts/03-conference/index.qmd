An internal data science conference is a great way to meet others across your organization and get other new users interested in your community. 

It can help keep your team current on new technology, increase collaboration, and give people a better idea of the work being done in other parts of the organization, and celebrate that work!

#### **Conference ideas:**

-   Company-wide data science day
-   Shiny Day
-   Data science hackathon/competition

#### **Examples:**

**AstraZeneca:**

AstraZeneca spoke about their internal R Conference, #AZRC2022, in a [blog post](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/building-a-community-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry/) and meetup. This was a fully virtual, half-day conference with Max Kuhn as a keynote speaker, more than 30 speakers, and close to 100 poster authors. They ran three parallel tracks: governance, machine learning, and reproducibility.

The World Bank hosted a Shiny Day (actually 2-days!) to demonstrate how Shiny can be used in the context of bank projects. From their [event overview site](https://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2021/04/28/-r-shiny-days), this included a series of lightning talks, a keynote by Carson Sievert from Posit's Shiny team, and interactive workshops.
