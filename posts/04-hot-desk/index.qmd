### AstraZeneca

AstraZeneca launched the R Hot Desk at their [Gothenburg site](https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-company/our-locations/gothenburg.html). The idea is the following: once a month, a few R experts meet in an open area of their offices and dedicate two hours of their time to answer R-related questions.

While this happens once a month, they have one R @ AZ initiative per week.

You can [learn more about their other initiatives here](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/building-a-community-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry/).

### John Deere

The team at John Deere have groups around PowerBI, Tableau, Posit, Alteryx, Data Robot, etc.

They host "beginner office hours" every other week. Their team shared that by adding the word "beginner" to the office hours sessions grew their attendance by 10x!

Power users still dialed in to the beginner office hours, but they now felt more empowered to help other users because it was a space for beginners.
