On the second Tuesday of every month, we get together as group of community builders for a coffee hour. It's a casual, fun time to share a bit about the communities we're part of or the ones we'd like to start, learn from our community-builder peers, and just meet each other :)

-   How do we decrease the barrier to entry to speaking?
-   Data science leaders have imposter syndrome as well - can we lean into that to help others?
-   How to engage both beginners and experts?

### Tools:

-   What mediums are most helpful for engagement?
-   Potential formats for community events: office hours, presentations, structure vs open-ended?

### Organizational

-   How to ensure community members have protected time to learn?
